Fidelity International Limited | India
Technical Product Manager II (Data Lead)– Global Infrastructure Automation (Sep 2020 - Jul 2022)

Identified problem space & analyzed data to own & develop E2E lifecycle of an automation product, including defining & tracking KPIs reducing the delivery time of vulnerability detection & report generation by 5x
Situation: The manual process for server vulnerability detection was slow and created security risks. For any new team to start development on a new project, the PM used to request a new server flagged “green” which meant server going through a series of vulnerability and configuration checks. This process was tedious and required dependent teams to work together to complete the workflow. This entire process took ~10 business days.
Task: In an ambiguous environment, I needed to create an automation product from scratch.
Action: I identified the problem, defined KPIs, and managed the full product lifecycle. I designed and architected the entire automated workflow with Nexpose API integration for server scans and ServiceNow logging and auditing. We also ended up using NLP for remediations report generation based on scan reports to help the requestor fix issues quickly and with ease.
Result: Reduced vulnerability detection and report generation time by 5x from initially being 10 business days to just a few hours.

Steered product solutioning by crafting PRD & collaborating with 6 cross-functional teams to collect server backup data. Developed & automated reports for visualization enhancing data-driven decision making
Situation: A lack of centralized server backup data was causing production issues.
Task: My task was to design a centralized data collection and reporting solution.
Action: I crafted the PRD, collaborated with 6 teams, and delivered automated reports via a new Oracle DB.
Result: Decreased production issues by 43% and slashed data retrieval time by 19%.

Performed anomaly detection on 8,000+ servers to determine backup failure & compliance gaps; insights from analysis led to server decommissioning, optimizing resource allocation & achieving 7% cost savings
Situation: The company was incurring unnecessary costs from thousands of servers with backup failures.
Task: I needed to analyze server data to identify cost-saving opportunities.
Action: I performed anomaly detection on 8,000+ servers to find failures and unused "ghost" servers.
Result: My analysis led to a server decommissioning initiative that achieved 7% cost savings.

Architected a developer-centric RESTful API for automation workflows & standard changes for PaaS deployments to reduce time to market by 86%
Situation: Internal developers were slowed down by a manual and cumbersome process for PaaS deployments.
Task: My goal was to create a standardized, automated solution to accelerate their workflows.
Action: I designed and architected a secure, developer-centric RESTful API for automation. We utilized Layer7 for authentication and authorization, Jenkins for deployment and ServiceNow Standard Change Tickets for this workflow.
Result: Reduced the time-to-market for developer PaaS deployments by 86%.


Fidelity International Limited | India
Technical Product Manager I (Founding Member) – Global Infrastructure Automation (Jul 2019 - Aug 2020)

Implemented an ML-based model for forecasting operational costs during COVID by analyzing employee engagement statistics to optimize cost & achieve a cost accuracy rate of 91.4%
Situation: During COVID-19, the company needed to accurately forecast operational costs.
Task: I was tasked with developing a data-driven model to predict costs.
Action: I analyzed employee engagement stats (surveys, HR records and actual employee sensitive information) and implemented an ML forecasting model.
Result: The model achieved a cost accuracy prediction rate of 91.4%.

Demonstrated deep knowledge of developer workflows by defining & implementing standards for CI/CD pipelines, software testing, & integrations, which decreased post-deployment issues by 27%
Situation: As a new team, we lacked standardized practices, leading to frequent and costly post-deployment issues.
Task: I took the initiative to establish a robust, end-to-end development lifecycle to improve quality and predictability.
Action: I designed and implemented a comprehensive set of standards, centered around a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker for containerized deployments to our PaaS environment. The pipeline enforced critical quality gates, including a 70% unit test coverage check with SonarQube, and automated smoke, functional, and integration tests. To ensure stability and auditability, the process was integrated with ServiceNow to automatically manage change tickets and utilized a blue-green deployment strategy for safe releases.
Result: This effort directly led to a 27% decrease in post-deployment issues, creating a more stable and efficient development workflow for all dev teams.

Authored program onboarding guides, integration guides, release notes & knowledge base articles, lowering production incidents by 15%
Situation: Production incidents rooting from self-service platforms were often caused by a lack of clear user documentation.
Task: My objective was to reduce these incidents by providing high-quality guides.
Action: I authored a full suite of documentation, including onboarding guides, release notes, and knowledge base articles.
Result: My work successfully lowered production incidents by 15%.
